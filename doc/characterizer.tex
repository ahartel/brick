\chapter{Timing Characterizer}
\label{chap:timing_characterizer}

This chapter describes the automatic timing characterizer for full-custom
digital blocks.

It uses the following input data:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Parasitics net list of the design that has to be characterized
	\item Output file of the Calibre parasitics extractor that contains input
		capacitances of the input pins of the design
	\item A Python data structure that defines which pins have to be
		characterized
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

The work flow can be seen in \cref{fig:workflow_characterizer}.
The tool will split up the simulations that have to be done to fill a timing
table into separate threads. For example, setup and hold timing for a single
combination of clock and signal rise times and for all pins of the design will
be extracted by one thread. The next thread will simulate the design with a
different pair of clock and signal rise times.

Every thread performs a binary search for the setup and hold timing by varying
the individual time differences of the input signals and the clock signal. This
can be seen in \cref{fig:binary_search_characterizer}.

An example \tf{wscript} for using the timing characterizer can be seen in
\cref{sec:recipe_characterizer}.
