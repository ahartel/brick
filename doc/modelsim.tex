\section{Modelsim HDL simulation workflow}

The Modelsim tool chain implements a three-step\marginnote{3-step
process} workflow for building \gls{HDL} simulations. The tool
chain consists of four tools (of which two implement the same of the three
steps but for different languages):
\begin{itemize}
	\item \tf{vlog}/\tf{vcom} for compiling design files
	\item \tf{vopt} for optimizing a design hierarchy
	\item \tf{vsim} for simulating an elaborated design hierarchy
\end{itemize}

These tools will be described in detail in the following subsecitons.
