To run and test the examples in this chapter, you can go to to the path that is
specified for each example.

Prior to running any example you need to check that all \ti{Cadence Incisive}
programs are accessible and you need to follow the instructions in
\cref{sec:install}.

\section{Simulating with Cadence Incisive}
For background information about simulating \gls{HDL} design with \ti{Cadence
Incisive} please see \cref{chap:incisive}.
\subsection{Basic RTL simulation}
\label{sec:ius_basic_rtl}
The most basic \tf{wscript} for RTL simulation with \ti{Cadence Incisive} is
shown in the following listing. A running example of it can be found in the
folder \tf{test/cadence\_ius/sim\_rtl\_only\_0}.
\begin{lstwscript}
def configure(cfg):
    cfg.load('cadence_ius')

def build(bld):
    bld ( features = 'cds_write_libs' )
 
    bld (
        name = 'compile_top',
        features = 'cds_compile_hdl',
        source = bld.convert_string_paths(
            [
                'source_file0',
                'source_file1',
            ]),
        verilog_search_paths = bld.convert_string_paths(
            [
                'search_path0',
                'search_path1',
            ]
        ),
    )
 
    bld.add_group()
 
    bld (
        toplevel = 'worklib.tb_top',
        features = 'cds_elab',
        always = True
    )

def run(bld):
    bld (
        features = 'ncsim',
        toplevel = 'worklib.tb_top',
    )

from waflib.Build import BuildContext
class one(BuildContext):
    cmd = 'run'
    fun = 'run'
}
\end{lstwscript}

This \tf{wscript} sets up calls to \tf{ncvlog} for all files given to the
\ti{compile\_top} task generator. Afterwards it runs \tf{ncelab} on the given
toplevel unit. When typing \mint{bash}'./waf run',
\tf{ncsim} is invoked. By default, this starts a GUI version of \tf{ncsim}.
\subsubsection{Disabling the \tf{ncsim} GUI}
You can also start \tf{ncsim} without a GUI, by modifying the \tf{configure}
function of the wscript like this:
\begin{lstwscript}
def configure(cfg):
    cfg.load('cadence_ius')
    cfg.env['NCSIM_OPTIONS'].remove('-gui')
\end{lstwscript}

\subsubsection{Changing the worklib's name}
Any working library that is explicitely given by the user (i.e. written into
the \tf{hdl.var} file has to be listed in the \tf{cds.lib} file as well and the
directory that contains the library has to be created by the user.

To tell the \ti{Incisive} tools to use a different working library the
\tf{wscript} has to be modified like in the following code example. A running
example of it can be found in the folder
\tf{test/cadence\_ius/sim\_rtl\_only\_1}.

\begin{lstwscript}
def configure(conf):
    cfg.load('cadence_ius')
    cfg.env.CDS_LIBS = ['./myworklib']
    cfg.env.CDS_WORKLIB = 'myworklib'

def build(bld):
    ...
    bld (
        toplevel = 'mywork.tb_top',
        features = 'cds_elab',
        always = True
    )

def run(bld):
    bld (
        features = 'ncsim',
        toplevel = 'worklib.tb_top',
    )

...
\end{lstwscript}

It is worth noting that the workflow presented in this subsection also has to
be used for \gls{RVM}.

\subsection{Behavioral-Based Mixed-signal simulation}
\label{sec:ius_behave_rtl}
If you want to use \ti{Verilog-AMS} behaioral models that contain analog blocks
or signals of discipline electrical, the following \tf{wscript} snippet can
help you to set up a simulation. This \tf{wscript} can also be used when you
want to simulate schematics and the \ti{Verilog-AMS} files that are derived
from these schematics have already been netlisted. If, on the other hand, your
schematics have not yet been netlistet and you want them to get netlisted
automatically, please refer to \cref{sec:ius_schematic_rtl}.

The example code presented in this section can be found in the folder\\
\tf{test/cadence\_ius/sim\_mixed\_signal\_0} of the repository.

\begin{lstwscript}
import os

def configure(conf):
    conf.env.CDS_MIXED_SIGNAL = True

    conf.load('cadence_ius')

    conf.env['NCELAB_OPTIONS'].extend([
        '-amsconnrules', 'ConnRules_12V_full_fast',
        'ConnRules_12V_full_fast',
    ])

def build(bld):
    bld ( features = 'cds_write_libs' )

    bld (
        name = 'compile_top',
        features = 'cds_compile_hdl',
        source = bld.convert_string_paths(
            [
                'source_file0',
                'source_file1',
                os.environ['BRICK_DIR']+'/source/verilog-ams/ConnRules12.vams',
            ]),
        verilog_search_paths = bld.convert_string_paths(
            [
                'search_path0',
                'search_path1',
            ]
        ),
    )
    bld.add_group()
    bld (
        toplevel = 'worklib.tb',
        features = 'cds_elab',
        always = True
    )   

def run(bld):
    bld (
        features = 'ncsim',
        toplevel = 'worklib.tb',
        stop_time = '100n',
    )   

from waflib.Build import BuildContext
class one(BuildContext):
    cmd = 'run'
    fun = 'run'
\end{lstwscript}

In this listing, compared to the listing in \cref{sec:ius_basic_rtl}, lines 2,
6-9, 22 and 42 have been added and mark the important changes. The rest of the
listing has remained unchanged. The additional lines' purposes are described
next:
\begin{description}
    \item[Line 2:] The environment variable \tf{CDS\_MIXED\_SIGNAL} enables the
 mixed-signal flow. In particular, it changes the default options that are
 passed to \tf{ncelab} and tells to the task generator for the \tf{ncsim} task
 to create and use an analog control file.
    \item[Lines 6-9:] These add options to the \tf{ncelab} call that tell it to
 use the connect rules that are defined in line 22.
    \item[Line 22:] Adds a Verilog-AMS source file to the compilation process.
 This file defines connect rules for the automatic connect module insertion
 process that is handled by \tf{ncelab}.
    \item[Line 42:] Tells the task generator for the \tf{ncsim} task to set the
 stop time of the transient simulation to 100 ns.
\end{description}

\subsection{Schematic-Based Mixed-signal simulation}
\label{sec:ius_schematic_rtl}

The example code presented in this section can be found in the folder\\
\tf{test/cadence\_ius/sim\_mixed\_signal\_1} of the repository.

\begin{lstwscript}
import os

def configure(conf):
    conf.env.CDS_MIXED_SIGNAL = True

    conf.load('cadence_ius')
    conf.load('cadence_mixed_signal')
                                                                                       
    conf.env['CDS_LIBS']['brick_test'] = '../../cdslib/'
    conf.env.CDS_LIB_INCLUDES = [ 
        '$TSMC_DIR/oa/cds.lib',
    ]   

    conf.env['NCELAB_OPTIONS'].extend([
        '-amsconnrules', 'ConnRules_12V_full_fast', 'ConnRules_12V_full_fast',
        '-libverbose',
        '-modelpath',
        os.environ['TSMC_DIR']+'/oa/models/spectre/toplevel.scs(tt_lib)',
    ])

def build(bld):
    bld ( features = 'cds_write_libs' )

    bld (
        feature = 'cds_mixed_signal',
        cellview = 'lib.cell:view',
    )

    bld (
        name = 'compile_top',
        source = bld.convert_string_paths(
            [
                'source_file0',
                'source_file1',
                os.environ['BRICK_DIR']+'/source/verilog-ams/ConnRules12.vams',
            ]),
        features = 'cds_compile_hdl',
        verilog_search_paths = bld.convert_string_paths(
            [
                'search_path0',
                'search_path1',
            ]
    )
    bld.add_group()
    bld (
        toplevel = 'worklib.tb',
        features = 'cds_elab',
        always = True
    )

def run(bld):
    bld (
        features = 'ncsim',
        toplevel = 'worklib.tb',
        stop_time = '100n',
    )

from waflib.Build import BuildContext
class one(BuildContext):
    cmd = 'run'
    fun = 'run'
\end{lstwscript}

In this listing, compared to the listing in \cref{sec:ius_behave_rtl}, lines
25-28 contain the important changes. Otherwise the snippet has remained
unchanged (except for the implicit changes in the anonymous source file
placeholders).
\begin{description}
    \item[Line 42:] Adds a task generator call that creates 2 tasks, one for
        a netlisting task and a second one for a compilation task that compiles
        the resulting netlist.
\end{description}

\warningsign Note that the \ti{cadence\_mixed\_signal} tool needs a cell view
of type \ti{config}. If you don't already have a \ti{config} cell view at hand,
you can let \ti{brICk} create one by adding the following lines to your
\tf{wscript}.
\begin{lstwscript}
bld (                                                                          
    features = 'cds_config',
    name = 'create_some_config',
    libs = ['lib','tsmcN65'],
    cellview = 'lib.cell:config',
    update_outputs = True
)
\end{lstwscript}

Here, the \tf{cellview} property defines the toplevel cell view of the
hierarchy. The output cell view (the one that will be created by \ti{brICk})
will, by default, have the same cell name as the source cell view but will
reside in the working library and have view name \tf{brick\_config}. To
override this behavior, you can add the property \tf{config\_cellview} to the
call. It has to contain a string of type \tf{lib.cell:view}.

The \tf{update\_outputs} property has to be set to \ti{True}, if the file
that will be generated by this task does not reside in the build directory.

\subsubsection{Explicitely changing view names of compilation units}
In some cases, there are multiple representations of a module, e.g. a
behavioral and a full-custom schematic. It can happen that both are given as
\ti{Verilog-AMS} code (one written by the user and the other one generated by
the netlister. Therefore, both files would be compiled into the same view, one
overwriting the other. To differentiate between both you can compile both into
different views. This can be done with the \tf{view} attribute of the task
generator, as in the following example.

Once you have compiled both representations of the same module into different
views, you can tell \tf{ncelab} which one to pick by using the \tf{binding}
attribute of the task generator.

The example code presented in this subsection can be found in the folder\\
\tf{test/cadence\_ius/sim\_mixed\_signal\_2} of the repository.

\begin{lstwscript}
...

def build(bld):
    bld ( features = 'cds_write_libs' )

    bld (
        feature = 'cds_mixed_signal',
        cellview = 'lib.cell:view',
        view = 'schematic',
    )

    bld (
        name = 'compile_top',
        view = 'behavioral',
        source = bld.convert_string_paths(
            [
                'source_file0',
                'source_file1',
                os.environ['BRICK_DIR']+'/source/verilog-ams/ConnRules12.vams',
            ]),
        features = 'cds_compile_hdl',
        verilog_search_paths = bld.convert_string_paths(
            [
                'search_path0',
                'search_path1',
            ]
    )
    bld.add_group()
    bld (
        toplevel = 'worklib.tb',
        features = 'cds_elab',
        always = True,
        binding = ['lib.cell:schematic'],
    )

...
\end{lstwscript}

When using this attribute, \ti{brICk} translates it to a \tf{-view} option of
the \tf{ncvlog} calls.

\subsection{Basic RTL simulation}

\begin{lstwscript}
def configure(conf):
    conf.load('modelsim')

def build(bld):

    bld (
        name = 'compile_top',
        features = 'modelsim',
		source = bld.convert_string_paths(
            [
                'source_file0',
                'source_file1',
            ]),
        verilog_search_paths = bld.convert_string_paths(
            [
                'search_path0',
                'search_path1',
            ]
        ),
    )   


def run(bld):
    bld (
        features = 'vsim',
        toplevel = 'worklib.tb',
    )   

from waflib.Build import BuildContext
class one(BuildContext):
    cmd = 'run'
    fun = 'run'
\end{lstwscript}

\section{Checking and Extracting Layouts with Calibre}
\label{sec:calibre_recipes}
\subsection{Design Rule Check}
\label{sec:calibre_recipes_drc}
If you already have a \ti{GDSII} file, you can use the following minimal
\tf{wscript} to set up a \gls{DRC} with \ti{Calibre}.
This example can be found in the folder\\
\tf{test/calibre/drc\_inverter}.
\begin{lstwscript}
def configure(conf):

    conf.load('calibre_drc')

def build(bld):

    bld (
        name = 'calibre_drc_inverter',
        features = 'calibre_drc',
        cellname = 'inverter',
        layout_gds = bld.find_node('your.gds'),
        includes = [
            bld.root.find_node(/your/process/rule/file))
        ],
        unselect_checks = [
            #'M9.DN.2L',
        ]
    )

\end{lstwscript}

The \ti{task generator} called \tf{calibre\_drc\_inverter} sets up a rule file
for you. It will add include statements for the files that you'd specify
on line 11 and it will add \tf{DRC UNSELECT CHECK} statements for the checks that
you'd specified in lines 12-14.

\subsubsection{Running Calibre Designrev to inspect errors}
If you want to run \ti{Calibre Designrev} to inspect the errors that \gls{DRC}
has found in your layout you can add the following code to your \tf{wscript}
and execute \tf{./waf run} after you've run the check.

\begin{lstwscript}
def run(bld):
    bld (
        features = 'calibre_rve_drc',
        cellname = 'inverter',
        gds = bld.path.find_node('../brick_test_inverter.gds'),                                                                                                               
    )   

from waflib.Build import BuildContext
class one(BuildContext):
    cmd = 'run'
    fun = 'run'
\end{lstwscript}

\subsubsection{Generating the GDSII file on-the-fly}
If you want to run a \gls{DRC} on a layout that resides in one of your Cadence
libraries, you can let \ti{brick} generate a streamed-out \ti{GDSII} file for
you on-the-fly.
This example can be found in the folder
\tf{test/calibre/drc\_inverter\_streamout}.
\begin{lstwscript}
def configure(conf):

    conf.env['CDS_LIBS'] = {'brick_test': '../../cdslib/'}
    conf.env.CDS_LIB_INCLUDES = [
        '$TSMC_DIR/oa/cds.lib',
    ]

    conf.load('cadence_strmout')
    conf.load('calibre_drc')

def build(bld):
    bld ( features = 'cds_write_libs' )

    # Additional task generator for streamout
    inverter_streamout = bld (
        name = 'streamout_inverter',
        features = 'cds_strmout',
        cellview = 'brick_test.inverter:layout',
    )

    bld (
        features = 'calibre_drc',
        cellname = 'inverter',
        layout_gds = inverter_streamout.get_cadence_strmout_gds_node(),
        includes = [
            bld.root.find_node(/your/process/rule/file))
        ],
        unselect_checks = [
            #'M9.DN.2L',
        ]
    )
\end{lstwscript}

\subsection{Layout Versus Schematic}
The following code example demonstrates how to perform an \gls{LVS} check on a
layout and schematic that resides in one of your Cadence design libraries.
If you intend to perform the check on existing files (GDSII and spice netlist)
you can do so by changing lines 36 and 37 and by removing the netlisting and
streamout task generators.

The following example can be found in the folder
\tf{test/calibre/lvs\_inverter}.

\begin{lstwscript}
import os

def configure(conf):

    conf.env['CDS_LIBS'] = {'brick_test': '../../cdslib/'}
    conf.env.CDS_LIB_INCLUDES = [
        '$TSMC_DIR/oa/cds.lib',
    ]

    conf.load('cadence_strmout')
    conf.load('cadence_netlist')
    conf.load('calibre_lvs')

def build(bld):

    bld ( features = 'cds_write_libs' )

    inverter_streamout = bld (
        name = 'streamout_inverter',
        features = 'cds_strmout',
        cellview = 'brick_test.inverter:layout',
    )

    inverter_netlist = bld (
        name = 'cds_netlist_lvs_inverter',
        features = 'cds_netlist_lvs',
        cellview = 'brick_test.inverter:schematic',
        include = '/some/netlist/you/want/to/include'
    )


    bld (
        features = 'calibre_lvs',
        layout_cellname = 'inverter',
        source_cellname = 'inverter',
        layout_gds = inverter_streamout.get_cadence_strmout_gds_node(),
        source_netlist = inverter_netlist.get_cds_netlist_lvs_node(),
        includes = [
            bld.root.find_node(/your/process/rule/file))
        ],
    )

\end{lstwscript}

Please note that you can use the \ti{include} attribute of the
\tf{cds\_netlist\_lvs} \ti{task generator} to include a netlist into the result
netlist that is generated from the schematic. 

\subsection{Parasitics Extraction}
\label{sec:calibre_recipes_pex}

This example demonstrates how to perform a parasitics extraction on a layout
that resides in one of your Cadence design libraries. It can be found in\\
\tf{test/calibre/pex\_inverter}.

\begin{lstwscript}
def configure(conf):

    conf.load('calibre_pex')

def build(bld):

    pex = bld (
        name = 'xrc_inverter',
        features = 'calibre_pex',
        cellname = 'inverter',
        layout_gds = bld.path.find_node('your_gdsii_file'),
        includes = [
            bld.root.find_node(/your/process/rule/file))
        ],
        extract_include_recursive = True,
        only_extract_nets = [
            # Some net names
        ],
        # Some additional statements you want to put into the rule file
        mixins = [
            'LAYOUT RENAME TEXT "/</\\[/g" "/>/\\]/g"',
            'SOURCE RENAME TEXT "/</\\[/g" "/>/\\]/g"',
        ],
    )
\end{lstwscript}

Note that lines 15-23 are optional and can be used to extract only those nets
that you specify and add several Calibre rule-file statements to the rule file
that is generated by \ti{brICk}.
If you specify nets in the \tf{only\_extract\_nets} attribute, these net names
relate to the layout database. Usually, you would want to specify these nets
names as they appear in the schematic. For the tool to be able to match these
source net names to the layout, an LVS has to have been performed. The next
example shows how to combine the two.

\subsubsection{Using source netlist names}
The following example shows how to perform an \gls{LVS} check before running a
parasitics extraction. This allows you to use source (i.e. schematic) net names
in the \tf{only\_extract\_nets} attribute.
A running example of this can be found in
\tf{test/calibre/pex\_inverter\_sourcenames\_streamout}.

\begin{lstwscript}
def build(bld):
    ...

    # perform an LVS first
    bld (
        features = 'calibre_lvs',
        layout_cellname = 'inverter',
        source_cellname = 'inverter',
        layout_gds = inverter_streamout.get_cadence_strmout_gds_node(),
        source_netlist = inverter_netlist.get_cds_netlist_lvs_node(),
        includes = [
            bld.root.find_node(/your/process/rule/file))
        ],
    )

    pex = bld (
        name = 'xrc_inverter',

\subsubsection{Using xcells}
If you want to use xcells to reduce the complexity of the extracted netlist,
you can do so by specifying them via the \tf{hcells} and \tf{xcells} attributes
of the \ti{task generators}.
A running example of this can be found in\\
\tf{test/calibre/pex\_inverter\_sourcenames\_streamout}.

\begin{lstwscript}
def build(bld):
    ...

    # perform an LVS first
    bld (
        features = 'calibre_lvs',
        layout_cellname = 'inverter',
        source_cellname = 'inverter',
        layout_gds = inverter_streamout.get_cadence_strmout_gds_node(),
        source_netlist = inverter_netlist.get_cds_netlist_lvs_node(),
        includes = [
            bld.root.find_node(/your/process/rule/file))
        ],
        hcells = [
            #        'synapse synapse',

        ]
    )

    pex = bld (
        name = 'xrc_inverter',
        features = 'calibre_pex',
        cellname = 'inverter',
        layout_gds = inverter_streamout.get_cadence_strmout_gds_node(),
        source_netlist = inverter_netlist.get_cds_netlist_lvs_node(),
        includes = [
            bld.root.find_node(/your/process/rule/file))
        ],
        xcells = [
            #        'synapse synapse',
        ],
    )
\end{lstwscript}

This example assumes that there is a circuit called synapse that you want to
extract hierarchically.
