command line options: --users, --units, --rundirs

Gernerates a basic directory structure with given rundirs, user dirs and unit dirs.

Every user dir already contains some basic cds and cadence files.

Every unit dir already contains the subdirectories cdslib, source, abstract and constraints.

Every rundir contains an empty wscript and a link to the waf binary which is also copied to the project root.

Also creates the doc directory.

A .gitignore file is also already created.
