Some comments on the code in function check_timing() of class SetupHold_Char:

hold search
===========
We want to get as far as possible to low values

dir < 0 and delta_t < fail:
	continue,
	set upper threshold,
	same step size
dir < 0 and delta_t > fail:
	switch direction,
	set lower threshold,
	halve step size
dir > 0 and delta_t < fail:
	switch direction,
	set upper threshold,
	halve step size
dir > 0 and delta_t > fail:
	continue,
	set lower threshold,
	same step size
