sim_mixed_signal_0/
	Behavioral-Based mixed-signal simulation example (with default settings)
sim_mixed_signal_1/
	Schematic-Based mixed-signal simulation example (does not select
	schematic-based inverter explicitely)
sim_mixed_signal_2/
	Schematic-Based mixed-signal simulation example (does explicitely select
	schematic-based explicitely, compiles both the behavioral and the
	schematic-based inverter)
sim_mixed_signal_3/
	Example for testing interconnect type of systemverilog
sim_rtl_only_0/
	Simple RTL-only test-design, with default settings
sim_rtl_only_1/
	Same design as in sim_rtl_only_0, with a worklib chosen by the user
sim_rtl_only_2/
